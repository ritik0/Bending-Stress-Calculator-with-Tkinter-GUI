# Bending-Stress-Calculator-with-Tkinter-GUI
I have created a bending stress calculator using python language and used tkinter library for GUI creation.
Being a mechanical engineering student, i thought of computing bending stress which is frequently calculated for solving problem with python language.
I have also created a GUI(with Tkinter) for better interaction of mechanical students with computer programs.
